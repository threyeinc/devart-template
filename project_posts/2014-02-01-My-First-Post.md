Our world is facing some unsurmountable challenges. With every passing day, the ghastly situation is becoming more severe and beyond repair. We are threatening the natural habitat of species, their population is decreasing, more and more species are becoming extinct every year, forests cover is reducing and climate change is happening at such vast pace that it might not be very far into the future wherein we wouldn't know what hit us. The delicate balance of nature is oscillating between differnet amplitudes of draught and floods, over and under production, heat strokes and winter stroms and there are no signs of situation coming under control unless we take some steps at a global level, unless we inspire the next generation to understand the gravity of the situation and reinforce the love and care for nature. 


Even with such rapid exploitation of natural resources, we are not living a healthy lifestyle. More and more people are becoming obese and suffering from lifestyle diseases. The Question we ask from ourselves is, can we solve two biggest problems this world has ever seen by not forcing people but inspiring them to experience the surreal world and move millions of people to develop a better world, healthy life and relationships. Can we leverage technology and art for the same?

1) We strive to bring children closer to mother nature and wild life and help them immerse in the beauty of the wilderness. 

2) We want to motivate people to jog, run, take care of their health and spend more time with family.

For the same, we will use Kinect, Unity, Background subtraction tools, 3D models of wild flora and fauna, Google Hangout, Google Maps/ Earth and will produce some spectacular Augmented Reality use cases.
